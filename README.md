# Steam Cache Docker Container

## Introduction

This docker container provides DNS entries to be used in conjunction with a steamcache server.

The primary use case is gaming events, such as LAN parties, which need to be able to cope with hundreds or thousands of computers receiving an unannounced patch - without spending a fortune on internet connectivity. Other uses include smaller networks, such as Internet Cafes and home networks, where the new games are regularly installed on multiple computers; or multiple independent operating systems on the same computer.

## Usage

Run the steamcache-dns container using the following to allow UDP port 53 (DNS) through the host machine. Replace `STEAMCACHE_IP` with the IP address of your steamcache server.

```
docker run -it --name steamcache-dns -p 53:53/udp -e STEAMCACHE_IP=10.0.0.3 steamcache/steamcache-dns:latest
```

#### Additional options

* `-d` will run the docker container in the background. Access the logs with `docker logs steamcache`.
* `--network host` will use the host networking stack for improved performance.
* `--log-opt max-size=10m --log-opt max-file=3` will automatically rotate container logs.

## Quick Explaination

For a steam cache to function on your network you need two services.
* A depot cache service
* A special DNS service

The depot cache service transparently proxies your requests for content to Steam, or serves the content to you if it already has it.

The special DNS service handles DNS queries normally (recursively), except when they're about Steam and in that case it responds that the depot cache service should be used.

## DNS Entries

Modify `etc/dnsmasq.d/steamcache.conf` to add or remove DNS entries. These will occasionally change as game clients are updated.

## Running on Startup

Follow the instructions in the Docker documentation to run the container at startup.
